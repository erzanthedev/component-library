# Component Library

A customizable and reusable component library built with React.

## Features

- **Reusable Components**: A collection of pre-built React components ready to be integrated into your projects.
- **Customizable**: Easily customize components with props and styles to suit your design needs.
- **Modular Architecture**: Import only the components you need to keep your bundle size small.

## Installation

You can install the library via npm:

```bash
npm install your-component-library
```

or via yarn:

```bash
yarn add your-component-library
```

## Usage

To start using the components, import them into your project like this:

```jsx
import { Button, Card } from "your-component-library";

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Button label="Click Me" />
      <Card title="Card Title" content="This is a sample card" />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## Available Components

- **Button**: A customizable button component.
- **Card**: A card component for displaying content.
- More components coming soon!

## Customization

Each component comes with props that allow you to modify their appearance and behavior. For example, the `Button` component accepts the following props:

- `label` (string): The text to display on the button.
- `onClick` (function): The function to call when the button is clicked.
- `style` (object): Custom inline styles.

```jsx
<Button
  label="Submit"
  onClick={handleSubmit}
  style={{ backgroundColor: "blue", color: "white" }}
/>
```
